# **Apple Watches Can Once Again Measure Blood Oxygen**

Apple watches have a Health app connected to the system. 
The new Apple Watch Series 6 is going to provide technology to see if you're getting the proper amount of oxygen to vital organs.
It will measure the red blood cells percentage of oxygen that they bring to your lungs. 
It will help track signs of cardiac issues. The watch uses an oximeter, you can manually turn it on to get a blood oxygen check. 

The sensor uses four colours of LED lights on the back of the watch. 
The lights shine onto your blood vessels and they check how much light reflects back, thus calculating how much oxygen there is. 
It's not intended for medical use or self diagnosing. There could be miscalculations and issues depending on your location and altitude. 

The test takes 15 seconds, you must have the watch snug on your wrist and stay still or you wont have an accurate reading. 
It also keeps history of past readings, letting you compare.
